## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-assessment.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd path/to/counter-form-app

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# Start the development server
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

- Login/logout functionality
- Protected routes
- Authentication state management

# Component Architecture

## Components Overview

- **Counter**: Interactive counting component with animated visual feedback.  
- **Navbar**: Responsive navigation with authentication-aware menu items.  
- **TextEditor**: Rich text editor with user data integration.  
- **UserForm**: Form for collecting and storing user information.  

## State Management

The application uses several state management approaches:  

- **Component-level State**: Each component maintains its own state using React's `useState` hook.  
- **Cross-component Communication**: Custom browser events and shared `localStorage` data.  
- **Persistence Strategy**: `localStorage` for data persistence across browser sessions.  
- **Animation State**: `react-spring` for declarative animations tied to component state.  

## Component Details

### ðŸ”¹ Counter Component
- Uses `useState` to track counter value.  
- Implements `localStorage` persistence.  
- Animated background that grows based on counter value.  
- Button click effects using `react-spring`.  

### ðŸ”¹ Navbar Component
- Tracks authentication state.  
- Listens to custom `authChange` events.  
- Responsive design with mobile menu.  
- Authentication-aware navigation options.  

### ðŸ”¹ TextEditor Component
- Manages editor content with **ReactQuill** integration.  
- Loads user data from `localStorage`.  
- Auto-populates with user data from the **UserForm** component.  
- Animation effects when updating content.  

### ðŸ”¹ UserForm Component
- Form data tracked with `useState`.  
- Implements **unsaved changes detection**.  
- Uses `localStorage` for data persistence.  
- Form validation and unique user ID generation.  

## Animation System

Built with React Spring for:
- Smooth transitions between states
- Interactive feedback on user actions
- Background animations based on application state
- Gesture-based interactions
